**1. Introduction** 

There have been some critical dilemmas surrounding AI research, and the debate 
about the method that will enable us to approach human-level machine intelligence, or 
strong AI [1], has probably been one of the most crucial and controversial ones. Two 
different schools of thought, the one of symbolic AI [2] – which focuses on using discrete 
symbols and rules to represent knowledge- and that of neural nets (sub-symbolic AI) [3]- 
which model data through interconnected layers and nodes-, have had alternating periods 
of blossom throughout the last decades, with the latter experiencing a surge in its popularity 
in recent times with the developments in Deep Learning. However, and despite the fact 
many prominent AI researchers are still being unwilling to concede that, it has been argued 
for a while that both of these methods might have some distinct limitations that diminish 
the prospects of reaching strong AI systems with either of them; or more concisely, either of 
them alone. As a consequence, the potential of hybrid models, that try to combine features 
and architecture from both, has been researched, with Neurocompositional Computing [4] 
being a particularly intriguing idea with encouraging early results. 

Neurocompositional Computing, originally introduced as a concept from Cognitive 
Psychology, has led to a more holistic form of artificial intelligence that tries to mirror the 
duality of human cognition, described by the principles of Continuity and Compositionality. 
In fact, combining the fluidity of neural networks with the structured logic of symbolic 
systems, neurocompositional systems aim to achieve more robust learning. However, this is 
not the first time a new approach is introduced that has sparked a lot of hope and ambition 
in the AI research community. So is the attention and interest in this approach justified, or 
will it remain a concept that is useful in the narrow AI [1]– or, task-specific- domain? Motivated 
by its foundations, the problems it attempts to solve, as well as the first actual 
implementations – the target is to advance to the third generation of these systems in the 
time of writing – that have been very successful as will be discussed later, I firmly believe 
not only that there is more than enough merit to pursuing further development and 
progress in approaches in the Neurocompositional Computing domain for the purpose of 
reaching strong AI, but also that this hybrid approach is the first method with such a 
potential, as the traditional methods have hit what I consider to be an insurmountable 
roadblock.  

To present the underlying reasons for this opinion, this paper will first describe in 
section 2 what we could expect from a strong AI system and the reasons why approaching it 
with the traditional methods seems all the more unlikely, before giving a brief description of 
neurocompositional computing and its novelty in section 3.1. Afterwards, I will provide 
arguments about why I believe that these systems have the potential to reach the 
aforementioned heights. Moreover, I make an attempt to argue about how we would 
evaluate these systems as well as how they would perform in the current machine 
intelligence tests.
